## Acknowledgments

This is a port of the Wox plugin [Wox.Plugin.AwsToolkit](https://github.com/mikemorain/Wox.Plugin.AwsToolkit) (AWS Toolkit) created by Mike Morain ([@mikemorain](https://github.com/mikemorain)).

The Wox plugin, and therefore this plugin as well, was heavily inspired by the Alfred workflow: [AWS Console Services](https://github.com/rkoval/alfred-aws-console-services-workflow) created by Ryan Koval ([@rkoval](https://github.com/rkoval)).
